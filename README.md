This map shows the growth of Quebec City over time through its
amalgamation of nearby towns, which eventually became boroughs.
It briefly explains the historical considerations and the reasons both for and
against expansion of the city at various critical growth periods.
The use of the internet as an interactive medium allows the viewer
to click through the timeline and watch as the city grows and morphs
into what it is today.
Viewers can hover over the boroughs as they exist today to read more
and to see pictures representing them.

Quebec City has always been a comparatively small city without much industry,
so it has been trying for decades to find ways to grow.
On the one hand, incorporating new boroughs provided an easy way to make the
city seem as if it was growing, hopefully attracting people to move there and
create a virtuous cycle of growth.
On the other hand, doing so caused friction with the sense of local identity
of each former town, causing some boroughs to vote for separation
from the city just a few years later.
To combat the latter problem, the city government has tried very hard to blur
the lines between the former towns as much as possible, to the point that
it was difficult to find accurate information for this map beyond the 2002
reorganization.

This relates to the content of the class because it shows how Quebec City
has tried to evolve from a colonial-era town on a strategic site
to a modern "creative city," with mixed success.
It also shows how Quebec City's spatial structure is best described
by the multiple-nuclei model since most of its growth was in amalgamating
nearby existing towns.
