          <p>
            In 2002, as part of a widely criticized mass municipal reorganization in the province,
            Québec City was formed from the merger of the following nearby towns:

            voted in 2004 to de-merge from the city and become independent again.
            They formally separated in 2006.

            This is the central and most historic borough of Québec City.
            It was formed from the merger of the former boroughs La Cité and Limoilou in 2009.
            More than one in five residents live here.
            The port, the Château Frontenac, and many other historic landmarks
            are located in La Cité, which was the original city
            before the other boroughs were annexed.

            This borough was named for the Saint-Charles River and its tributaries
            which run through the borough.
            The borough was formed in 2002 from four towns that were annexed
            by the city in the 1970s.

            Sainte-Foy&ndash;Sillery&ndash;Cap-Rouge was formed by several mergers
            of the former towns of Sainte-Foy, Sillery, and Cap-Rouge.
            Sainte-Foy is a major economic area of the city,
            while Sillery and Cap-Rouge are more quiet and historic.
            It became part of Québec City in 2009.

          <p>
            Charlesbourg was founded as a Jesuit colony in 1659.
            It had a very unique spatial model during colonial times:
            the town was centered on the cathedral,
            and lots were drawn in triangles radiating from it.
            This aided in defense and increased neighborly proximity.
            It was annexed by Québec City in 2002.

            Beauport, one of the earliest European settlements in Canada,
            was founded in 1634.
            It merged with six other nearby towns in the 1970s,
            and was annexed by Québec City in 2002.

            This borough was created in 2002 when Québec City annexed
            five nearby towns.
            It was named for the Lake Saint-Charles,
            the source of the Saint-Charles River.
            It supplies half of the city's drinking water.
