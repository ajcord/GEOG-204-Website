            <h2>Expansion in Quebec City</h2>
            <p>
              Quebec City, Canada has a long history of municipal mergers
              behind the boroughs (also called <i>arrondissements</i>)
              that exist today.

            <h2>Pre-1909</h2>
            <p>
              Originally, Quebec City was divided into two sectors:
              Basse-Ville (Lower Town) and Haute-Ville (Upper Town).
              As the names suggest, this division was based primarily on
              the city's main geographical feature: a promontory overlooking
              the St. Lawrence River.
            </p>
            <p>
              The surrounding towns and parishes were politically distinct
              from the city, similar to most suburbs' relationships
              with cities in the US.

              A neighboring town named Limoilou was incorporated into the city
              in 1909, marking the beginning of Quebec City's trend of amalgamation.
              At the time of the merger, Limoilou had just started becoming
              urbanized within the past couple of decades.

            <p>
              In 1970, an administrative division for the Quebec City area
              called Communauté urbaine de Québec (CUQ) was created.
              The CUQ added a new sector to Quebec City called
              Les Rivières by merging four nearby towns.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 1970s, several of the surrounding towns were merged
              into each other as well&mdash;some of which would later
              become boroughs within Quebec City.

              In 2002, as part of a controversial mass municipal reorganization in the province,
              Quebec City was formed from the merger of the following nearby towns:

              voted in 2004 to de-merge from the city and become independent again.
              They formally separated in 2006.

              This is the central and most historic borough of Quebec City.
              It was formed from the merger of the former boroughs La Cité and Limoilou in 2009.
              More than one in five residents live here.
              The port, the Château Frontenac, and many other historic landmarks
              are located in La Cité, which was the original city
              before the other boroughs were annexed.

              This borough was named for the Saint-Charles River and its tributaries

              The borough was formed in 2002 from four towns that were annexed

              Sainte-Foy&ndash;Sillery&ndash;Cap-Rouge was formed by several mergers
              of the former towns of Sainte-Foy, Sillery, and Cap-Rouge.
              Sainte-Foy is a major economic area of the city,
              while Sillery and Cap-Rouge are more quiet and historic.
              It became part of Quebec City in 2009.

            <p>
              Charlesbourg was founded as a Jesuit colony in 1659.
              It had a very unique spatial model during colonial times:
              the town was centered on the cathedral,
              and lots were drawn in triangles radiating from it.
              This aided in defense and increased neighborly proximity.
              It was annexed by Quebec City in 2002.

              Beauport, one of the earliest European settlements in Canada,
              was founded in 1634.
              It merged with six other nearby towns in the 1970s,

              This borough was created in 2002 when Quebec City annexed
              five nearby towns.
              It was named for the Lake Saint-Charles,
              the source of the Saint-Charles River.
              It supplies half of the city's drinking water.
